# What is this? 

A simple repo for me to learn about [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) in Clojure.

# How do I run this?

You'll need [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) and [deps](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli). Then fire up a REPL (I like to use [Calva](https://calva.io)) and load the namespace [core.clj](src/core.clj). The `comment` and the bottom of the file contains function calls demonstrating the concepts.
